      <h3>Learn more about me</h3>
      <p>
        Design, development, management and organization, that is my definition of IT.<br/><br/>
        
        By nature, I have perseverance, and I'm rigorous, enthusiastic, never fully satisfied, and always listening. I began web development at 12, which is now my preferred field.<br/>
        
        I am currently a French student in IT engineering (fifth and last year),and concepteor DevOps. I'm trained to develop innovative websites in modern languages.<br/>
        
        I train myself with a lot of online trainings, on websites like uDemy, Microsoft Virtual Academy, and others because front-end languages change every day.<br/><br/>
        
        Passionate about IT, but also aeronautics and music creation, I am interested in innovation in multiple fields, which permits me to learn new things about them!
